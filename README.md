## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

This project was built to create an online presence for Bar do Léo, a local bar known for its welcoming atmosphere and diverse menu offerings. The website is designed to give visitors a glimpse into the bar's ambiance and menu.

Key Features:

- Navigation: A navigation bar with links to different sections of the website for easy access.
- About Us: A section detailing the bar's atmosphere and offerings, emphasizing the diverse menu and relaxed experience.
- Menu Showcase: Display of select dishes offered by the bar, with a unique hover effect revealing the name of each dish.
- Contact Information: Footer containing essential contact details, including address and opening hours.

## Optimizations

During the development of this project, I focused on refining the mobile layout to ensure a smooth and visually pleasing experience on smaller screens. By using responsive design principles, I enhanced the readability and usability of the website on various devices.

Given more time, I would have implemented a hamburger menu for improved navigation on smaller screens. This would have provided a more user-friendly way to access the different sections of the website, enhancing overall accessibility and user experience.

Despite not implementing the hamburger menu in this version, the optimizations made have paved the way for a more responsive and accessible website.

## Lessons Learned:

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of creating engaging user experiences. I learned to use CSS effectively to create visually appealing designs, as well as to structure HTML for better organization and accessibility. Designing with responsiveness in mind allowed me to ensure a seamless experience across different devices. This project also reinforced the importance of attention to detail in design and content presentation.
